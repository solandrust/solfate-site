In this special episode, we compare and contrast some of the differences between
Solana and Ethereum. We are joined by two developers,
[Cami](https://twitter.com/camiinthisthang) and
[Conner](https://twitter.com/colludingnod. Each have been around the blockchain
sphere for years and both have more experience from outside the Solana
ecosystem.

We talk about the one of the recent issues on the Ethereum chain and why it was
not considered a network outage. Including some details about how Proof of Stake
networks validate transactions.
