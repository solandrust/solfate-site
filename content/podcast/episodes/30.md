As our first repeat guest, [Mert](https://twitter.com/0xMert_) joins to kick off
the Only Possible On Solana hackathon that he is spearheading from within the
Solana community. This community driven hackathon is being orchestrated by
[LamportDAO](https://discord.gg/fM5Cp3cSzC), an open discord community of
builders in the Solana ecosystem.

The idea is simple: encourage people to build cool and interesting products
using the unique tech that is either Only Possible on Solana (aka OPOS) and get
them paid for it.

Some of the OPOS tech includes:

- state compression
- compressed NFTs
- Solana Pay (aka QR code based interactions)
- Solana Mobile Stack (aka SMS aka some of the Solana phone tech stack)
- fast transactions, low costs
- and so much more
