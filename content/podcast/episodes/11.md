After the USDC depeg, and return to peg, James and Nick talk high level about how USDC works. And a bit about some US financial systems.

The James talks about TinyDancer, the Grizzlython hackathon submission of a Solana lite client, and what it could mean for the broader Solana ecosystem.

Nick makes a case for how Elusiv is a game change protocol for Solana and blockchain in general. Allowing people to have private on-chain transactions, while still enabling tracking of bad actors and illicit funds.
