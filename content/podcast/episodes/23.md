James and Nick talk about the ideas of secure crypto/blockchain key storage
mechanisms that allow various services (like MagicLink and TipLink) to enable
user’s to own a private key via their email address. Enabling them to not need

Also, like usual, Nick is building a new tool/product. Using Solana Pay…
