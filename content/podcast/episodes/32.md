The [Web3 Builders Alliance](https://web3builders.dev/) (WBA for short) is a
white glove developer school, focused on blockchain. The people focking ship.
How? Because they are all about the people.

Co-founder of the Web3 Builders Alliance,
[Jeff (aka @japarjam)](https://twitter.com/japarjam), shares his background of
not only coming from outside the tech industry as a traditional educator, but
also his experience with cancer.

We talk about how the cadets in each WBA cohort have to prove themselves in a
few different ways: from simply showing up every day, to their initial screening
process. Participants will attend 1 of the 2 sessions a day, spaced 12 hours
apart to support builders around the world. Having already completed 2 cohorts,
with 11 projects shipped in the first cohort (including 5 global Solana
hackathon submissions, they recently started their third cohort.

Aside from their clear capability to get code shipped during each cohort (11
projects and 5 hackathon submissions during cohort 1), Jeff and WBA are also
cooking a few new opportunities for their graduates.

The new “Artisan group” is a small group of WBA graduates that are teaming
together for employment by the WBA. These select individuals are going to
continue to work together after completing their cohort to continue to build
projects for the rest of the Solana ecosystem as part of the new WBA dev shop.

The Artisan group already have a few very cool products they are working on.
