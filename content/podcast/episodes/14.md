For this special episode, we are joined by Noah Prince. One of the Solana devs
behind the massive effort of migrating the Helium Network to Solana.

Noah shares some of his background and how his brother, founder of Metaplex,
convinced him to start developing on Solana.

He also shares a high level, but still technical overview of how the Helium
network works. From the oracles to physical hotspots as compressed NFTs.

Noah also explains the process of how the Helium L1 blockchain will be “lazily”
migrated to its new home on Solana using compression. Allowing Helium to migrate
to Solana in an incredibly efficient and secure way without causing a massive
amount of congestion on Solana mainnet.

## Learn about State Compression on Solana

Nick has been diving deep into creating content for State Compression and
compressed NFTs. It is all live! Check out these resources to get up to speed on
compression:
