The true Solana legend, [Armani Ferrante](https://twitter.com/armaniferrante)
joins.

We get a glimpse into the personality of Armani Ferrante, the creator of the
Anchor Framework and founder of Coral, the organization behind xNFTs, MadLads,
and the Backpack wallet.

Armani shares his thoughts on leadership and his mindset about leading by
example. Empowering others to get things done. Armani describes a mental
framework of sorts about how he views the product landscape his company, Coral,
is working on. From building a consumer application (Backpack), to designing a
new protocol (xNFTs), to maintaining a development framework (Anchor).
