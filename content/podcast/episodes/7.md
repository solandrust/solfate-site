HadeSwap acquired Solana Monkey Business. marginfi started collecting funds for
their new on chain lending protocol, and a SolDev redesign? Crazy week.

James and Nick discuss the upcoming SolDev redesign that Nick will be coding the
frontend for. James gives his thoughts on the Solana Course he wrote, including
Solana Pay and how powerful it is! James updates Nick on how Solana Pay works
and it blows his mind!!!!

Nick also just had his last day at his previous job, and is gearing up for his
next role….what could it be?

If anyone is interested in getting early access to the new marginfi lending
protocol, you can message [Mac Brennan](https://twitter.com/macbrennan) on
twitter for details.

James and Nick welcome [Vibhu](https://twitter.com/vibhu), founder of Solana
Spaces and the [DRiP.haus](http://drip.haus), on to the episode where they talk
about programable NFTs and the mutability of NFTs and data storage.

Nick seems passionate about some NFTs staying immutable, while Vibhu and James
are less convinced. But everyone seems to agree the “wallet” terminology might
need a refresh.
