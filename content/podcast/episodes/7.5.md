We talk Vibhu's background of building companies and starting Solana Spaces, how and why Solana Spaces started, and the interesting tech behind it. And the sad announcement that SolanaSpaces will be shutting down by the end of the month (February 2023).

On a brighter note, Vib and team are making the intentional pivot to focus on drip.haus, their NFT drop platform that has rapidly reach massive scale in the bear market. From gathering 100k plus active users/wallets to fighting spam and detecting/labeling >60k spam wallets on the Solana network. And what the dip collection means to Vibhu and what they look for in the artwork drops.

Fun fact: Did you know the tech behind DRiP is what is powering the Saga Cards rewards system?
