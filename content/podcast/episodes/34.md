A conversation with [Tommy Johnson](https://twitter.com/tomjohn1028), founder of
PsyFi and [PsyOptions](https://PsyOptions.io).

Tommy has been in the Solana ecosystem longer than most, having participated in
one of the first global hackathons. From building one of the first options
markets on Solana, to now launching their latest product: ArmadaFi.

The goal of the ArmadaFi platform is to allow people to create better tokenomics
by providing the tools teams need to pull it off.

Having been through the ups and downs of the blockchainâ€™s financial markets, and
working in the DeFi world, Tommy shares his insights on how the journey was
first hand. And why this has helped shaped his opinions on blockchain based
financial markets.
