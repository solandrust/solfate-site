Nick finally got his Saga test unit, and he is blown away. The gents talk specs and the pure beauty of the Saga phone, from hardware to software.

Nick lectures James on the importance of a hardware wallet, and his strong feelings about them. And compares other Android phones in the market to the Saga.
