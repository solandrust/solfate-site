Nick gets the mythical email to order his Solana Mobile phone but struggles to do so. In the meantime, we talk about the game change we expect the Saga phone to be.

Also taxes. Nick and James talk broadly about how the US handles crypto taxes, which is…less than good…. So we spitball on some options.

Then Nick reveals his unique day job.
