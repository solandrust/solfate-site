James and Nick welcome [Vibhu](https://twitter.com/vibhu), founder of Solana Spaces and the [DRiP.haus](http://drip.haus), on to the episode where they talk about programable NFTs and the mutability of NFTs and data storage.

Nick seems passionate about some NFTs staying immutable, while Vibhu and James are less convinced. But everyone seems to agree the “wallet” terminology might need a refresh.
