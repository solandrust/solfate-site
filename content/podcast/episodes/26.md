The founders of Margin fi, [Edgar](https://twitter.com/edgarpavlovsky) and
[Mac](https://twitter.com/macbrennan), share how they got into crypto and why
they decided to dive in full time into the DeFi ecosystem.

They both explain how they adjust their building plans based on the macro
conditions and their actual product usage. Tailoring their product roadmap to
the types of users they are getting at the time, while still keeping a longer
term vision in mind.

Edgar explains the concept of "over collateralization" in the finance world, and
why it is such a useful safety mechanism for DeFi lending and borrowing. Even
though it is not an end-all-be-all safety solution (due to price fluctuations in
token prices), it might need to be a fundamental safety feature for
permissionless protocols.

Mac also teases some alpha for Margin fi and an upcoming points based system for
protocol usage, maybe with a reward system. And why he thinks having a reward
system is important for projects/protocols that do not yet have a token.

Also, Mac decided he wanted to be shirtless for the episode...
