James is out for the week, but Nick is joined by Shek, the founder of
[Wordcel](https://www.wordcelclub.com/) and the [Gum protocol](https://gum.fun).

Shek shares his reasoning for founding Wordcel, the Solana native blogging
platform. And how that later evolved into the Gum protocol.

We dive into some of the more technical aspects oh how Wordcel works under the
hood, and the potential scaling issues of indexing the Gum protocol once it uses
State Compression.

Shek also explain a recent initiative on Solana: session keys.
