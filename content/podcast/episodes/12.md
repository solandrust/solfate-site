We are joined by the Mert, the vocal Solana supporter and founder of
[helius.xyz](http://helius.xyz)

As a former Coinbase employee, we got Mert’s take on the recent SEC
action/notice.

We talk about Mert’s spicy twitter life and the role he plays in the Solana (and
broader crypto ecosystem).

Mert shares some of his thoughts on what blockchain products are good at doing,
and maybe some things that are over-rated or over-hyped.

And then compression: we talk about State Compression on Solana, and the
perspective of handling the compression from the side of indexing providers and
developer platforms.

A “PS” Note from Mert: Grifter’s exist throughout the world, not just in crypto.
